			<h1 class="name">Hello! I'm John.</h1>
			<p class="sub-text w-50">
				Welcome to my little place on the internet. I‚Äôve been designing and building websites for a few years. I had the privilege to:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Help over 100,000 developers a month through my articles.</li>
				<li>Make super in-depth courses like Learn JavaScript and Mastering Responsive Typography.</li>
				<li>Give talks at conferences (like this and this) and workshops in lands far away from where I live (a tiny country called Singapore)</li>
			</ol>

			<h1>Here‚Äôs a little story of how I got started.</h1>
			<div class="story-text">
				<p>People think you need degrees to ‚Äúmake it‚Äù as a designer or developer. You don‚Äôt. I started with nothing.</p>

				<p>I came from a Finance background. I was afraid to code. <strong>I thought coding was something I would never be good at</strong> (even if I died trying üò®).</p>

				<p>I only started learning to code at 25 years old (one year before I graduated from university) because I didn‚Äôt want to work in a bank when I graduated.</p>

		<div class="crazy-part mt-5">
			<h1>That‚Äôs crazy!</h1>
			<p>Yup! I know! It‚Äôs been a hell of a ride. Here‚Äôs two more things I never imagined I could do (but I went ahead did them):</p>
			<p><strong>It‚Äôs amazing how far you can go when you don‚Äôt stop yourself.</strong> You‚Äôre much better than you think you are. This statement is for both of us.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="help mt-5">
			<h1>How I can help you.</h1>
			<p>I taught myself how to design and code. It was HARD. So I understand what you‚Äôre battling with: Lots of information and no direction.</p>
			<p>Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm here to help.</p>
			<p>First, <strong>I know a lot about the web</strong> since I‚Äôve worked in it for so long. I constantly reinvent my techniques as new technology appears, and I‚Äôm more than happy to share my technqiues with you.</p>
			<p>Second, <strong>I‚Äôm insanely practical.</strong> I only teach techniques and frameworks that I use. If you‚Äôre worried about keeping up, just stay along with me and I‚Äôll help filter the important stuff from the fluff.</p>
